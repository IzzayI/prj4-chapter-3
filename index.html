		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>
			The name of the poodle comes from the German word <em>pudeln</em>, which means splash in water. 
			The poodle used to be a popular breed for water-hunts of noblemen before the 19th century, therefore the name.
			The exact country of origin is officially France, though.
